# This is a simple example of Merge Conflict.
# It shows the merge conflict between branches "branch_one" and "branch_two".

# Both branches will make changes to Line 6 on the same file (MergeConflictExample.txt) which is the file you are currently looking at.


This was written from "branch_two" (to resolve Merge Conflict)
Now safe to merge
